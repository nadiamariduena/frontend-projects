<br>

> **I dedicated a couple of months to learn** from scratch **'3d modeling'**, so that i could progress more in my path to learn about 3d configuration for e-commerce products. I also learn how to render and set up environments to showcase Industrial designs<br><br> Then I spend a couple of weeks between designing and developing the website and building the **threejs** scene that you [can see in this link](https://preview-volkanuve-lb5ez1y5m-nadiamariduena.vercel.app/Furniture).
