I also learnt how to render and set up environments to showcase Industrial designs<br><br> Subsequently I spend a couple of weeks between designing and developing the website and building the **THREEJS scene** that you [can check on this link](https://preview-volkanuve-lb5ez1y5m-nadiamariduena.vercel.app/Furniture).
